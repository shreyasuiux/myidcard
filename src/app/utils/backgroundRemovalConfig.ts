/**
 * ⚠️ DEPLOYMENT FIX: Background Removal Configuration
 * 
 * This configuration is specifically designed to work in PRODUCTION/DEPLOYED environments
 * Not just in Figma Make, but also when published to live websites.
 * 
 * Key fixes for deployment:
 * 1. Absolute CDN URLs for all assets
 * 2. CORS-enabled fetch configuration
 * 3. Single-threaded mode (no SharedArrayBuffer needed)
 * 4. Proper WASM path configuration

/**
 * ⚠️ DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST:
 * 
 * When you deploy/publish your website, make sure:
 * 
 * 1. ✅ This configuration file loads BEFORE any background removal
 * 2. ✅ Your hosting allows loading assets from CDN (jsdelivr.net)
 * 3. ✅ CORS is not blocked by your hosting provider
 * 4. ✅ Your build process doesn't try to bundle WASM files
 * 5. ✅ Browser console shows "ONNX Runtime configured for PRODUCTION"
 * 
 * Common deployment issues:
 * - Model files 404: Check CDN URLs are accessible
 * - CORS errors: Check browser console, might need CDN fallback
 * - WASM errors: Check if hosting blocks WebAssembly
 * - Slow loading: First load downloads model (~20MB), cached after
 * 
 * Debug in production:
 * Open browser console and look for:
 * - "✓ ONNX Runtime configured for PRODUCTION"
 * - "📥 Downloading AI model: X%"
 * - "🤖 Processing: X%"
 * 
 * If you see errors, check:
 * 1. Network tab: Are CDN requests succeeding?
 * 2. Console tab: Any CORS or security errors?
 * 3. Application tab: Is the model cached?
